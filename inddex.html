      <li>HE WROTE THE HUGELY INFLUENTIAL ARYABHATIYA</li>
      Aryabhatiya contains a systematic treatment of the position of the planets in space; the nature of the Solar System; and the causes of eclipses of the Sun and the Moon. The mathematical part of the Aryabhatiya covers arithmetic, algebra, plane trigonometry and spherical trigonometry. 
      <li>ARYABHATTA WAS THE FIRST KNOWN PERSON TO SOLVE DIOPHANTINE EQUATIONS</li>
      A Diophantine equation is an equation that has more than one unknown integer.Diophantine equations were considered very difficult to solve at the time and the Kuttaka method quickly became very popular. It is still the standard method of solving such equations.
      <li>HE MADE MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO TRIGONOMETRY AND ALGEBRA</li>
      Aryabhatiya provides simple solutions to complex mathematical problems of the time like summing the first n integers, the squares of these integers and also their cubes. Furthermore, Aryabhatta correctly calculated the areas of a triangle and of a circle.
      <li>HE MOST PROBABLY UNDERSTOOD THE CONCEPT OF ZERO AND THE PLACE VALUE SYSTEM</li> 
      In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhatta introduced a system of numerals in which he used letters of the Indian alphabet to denote numbers. His numeral system allowed numbers up to 1018 to be represented with an alphabetical notation. It is considered that Aryabhatta was familiar with the concept of zero and the place value system.
      <li>HE CALCULATED THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATE VALUE OF PI TILL THAT TIME</li>
      One of the most important achievements of Aryabhatta is giving an approximate value of Pi (π). An account of this is found in the second part of Aryabhatiyam where he explains “Add four to 100, multiply by eight, and then add 62,000. By this rule, the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20,000 can be approached.” This calculation gives the vale of pi to be 62832/20000 = 3.1416, reflecting an accuracy of 5 significant digits. In fact π = 3.14159265 correct to 8 places. 
      <li>HE MADE INCREDIBLY ACCURATE CALCULATIONS OF THE LENGTH OF THE DAY AND THE YEAR</li>
      Aryabhata calculated the circumference of the Earth as 39,968 kilometers while the actual circumference is 40,075 kilometers. Thus Aryabhatta’s value of the size of the earth is only 0.2% smaller than the actual size.
      <li>HE WAS FIRST TO EXPLAIN THAT MOON AND PLANETS SHINE DUE TO REFLECTED SUNLIGHT</li>
      Even with the lack of any accurate astronomical instruments at the time, Aryabhata was able to successfully deduce that the Earth is round and revolves around its axis. Furthermore, he connected this with the existence of the day and night.
